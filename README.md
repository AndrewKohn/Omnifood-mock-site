## About This Project
This is a standalone mock website that portrays an AI-driven meal delivery service marketed towards those that want healthier lifestyle choices & ease of setting up meal plans.

## Purpose
This mock website was created to help implement HTML/CSS fundamentals to a working website that looks professional.  It helped me realize the importance of reusable components and helped me learn about responsive web design, browser support issues, optimizations, SEO, UI/UX, and site performance, as well as dabble in a bit of Javascript to understand its syntax/functionality.
